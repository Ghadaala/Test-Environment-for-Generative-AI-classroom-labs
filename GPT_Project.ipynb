Common delimiters include comma, tab, colon, vertical bar, and space.\\rNoSQL databases\\rDatabases are designed to store and manage unstructured data and provide analysis tools for examining this type of data.\\rOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems\\rSystems that focus on handling business transactions and storing structured data.\\rRelational databases\\rDatabases are designed to store structured data with well-defined schemas and support standard data analysis methods and tools.\\rSensors\\rDevices such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags generate structured data.\\rSpreadsheets\\rSoftware applications like Excel and Google Spreadsheets are used for organizing and analyzing structured data.\\rSQL Databases\\rDatabases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data in structured formats.\\rTab-separated values (TSVs)\\rDelimited text files where the delimiter is a tab. Used as an alternative to CSV when literal commas are present in text data.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\nProgramming Ocean Academy- Data Science Bootcamp - Feb 2024\\rTerm\\rDefinition\\rData Repository\\rA general term used to refer to data that has been collected, organized, and isolated so that it can be used for business operations or mined for reporting and data analysis. It can be a small or large database infrastructure with one or more databases that collect, manage, and store data sets. In this video, we will provide an overview of the different types of repositories your data might reside in, such as databases, data warehouses, and big data stores, and examine them in greater detail in further videos.\\rDatabase\\rA collection of data, or information, designed for the input, storage, search and retrieval, and modification of data. A Database Management System, or DBMS, is a set of programs that creates and maintains the database. It allows you to store, modify, and extract information from the database using a function called querying.\\rRelational Databases\\rAlso referred to as RDBMSes, relational databases build on the organizational principles of flat files, with data organized into a tabular format with rows and columns following a well-defined structure and schema. Unlike flat files, RDBMSes are optimized for data operations and querying involving many tables and much larger data volumes. Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the standard querying language for relational databases.\\rNon-Relational Databases\\rAlso known as NoSQL, or \"Not Only SQL\", non-relational databases emerged in response to the volume, diversity, and speed at which data is being generated today, mainly influenced by advances in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and social media proliferation. Built for speed, flexibility, and scale, non-relational databases made it possible to store data in a schema-less or free-form fashion. NoSQL is widely used for processing big data.\\rData Warehouse\\rA central repository that merges information coming from disparate sources and consolidates it through the extract, transform, and load process (ETL process) into one comprehensive database for analytics and business intelligence. At a very high-level, the ETL process helps you to extract data from different data sources, transform the data into a clean and usable state, and load the data into the enterprise\\'s data repository.\\rData Marts\\rData marts are subsets of data warehouses that focus on specific business lines or departments.\\rData Lakes\\rData lakes are repositories that store vast amounts of raw data in its native format until it is needed.\\rBig Data Stores\\rDistributed computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale, and process very large data sets.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\nProgramming Ocean Academy- Data Science Bootcamp - Feb 2024\\rTerm\\rDefinition\\rRelational Database\\rA collection of data organized into a table structure, where the tables can be linked based on common data. Tables consist of rows and columns, with rows representing records and columns representing attributes. Tables can be related based on shared data, allowing for the retrieval of new tables with a single query. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying data. They minimize data redundancy, offer data integrity through data type constraints, and provide security features for controlled access to data.\\rExamples of Relational Databases\\r- IBM DB2 - Microsoft SQL Server - MySQL - Oracle Database - PostgreSQL - Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) - Google Cloud SQL - IBM DB2 on Cloud - Oracle Cloud - SQL Azure\\rAdvantages of Relational Databases\\r- Flexibility: Changes can be made to the database structure while it\\'s running. - Reduced redundancy: Minimizes data duplication. - Ease of backup and disaster recovery: Offers easy export/import options and continuous mirroring in cloud-based solutions. - ACID-compliance: Ensures data accuracy and consistency. - Well-documented and mature technology.\\rUse Cases for Relational Databases\\r- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): Well-suited for transaction-oriented tasks with frequent queries and updates. - Data Warehouses: Optimized for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) for historical data analysis. -

It detects basic patterns like edges, textures, or color gradients.\\rFeature Map\\rThe output of the convolution operation is a feature map, which highlights important features from the image in a simplified, spatially structured format.\\rPooling\\rPooling reduces the size of the feature map by summarizing the most important information, helping the model become more efficient and less sensitive to small variations.\\rPooled Feature Map\\rThe result after pooling is a down-sampled version of the feature map that retains the essential characteristics of the image.\\rConvolution & Pooling (again)\\rThese steps are repeated multiple times to extract more complex and higher-level features from the image.\\rFlatten Layer\\rThe pooled feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector, which can be passed into the next layers for further processing or classification.\\rFully Connected Layer\\rThe flattened feature vector is connected to a fully connected layer, where all features are combined and analyzed to make a final prediction.\\rOutput\\rThe network outputs a set of probabilities for each possible class.

Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.\\rRegularization\\rA technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty (or constraint) to the loss function. Common methods include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\\rRegularization Rate\\rA hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularization applied. A higher regularization rate increases the penalty on larger weights, helping to simplify the model and reduce overfitting.\\rRatio of Training to Test Size\\rThe proportion of the dataset used for training versus testing (or validation). A typical split might be 80% training and 20% testing. The training set is used for learning, while the test set evaluates model performance on unseen data.\\rNoise\\rUnwanted variations or randomness in the data that can distort the learning process.

Each neuron in this layer corresponds to one feature from the input data.\\rHidden Layers\\rIntermediate layers between the input and output layers, where most of the computations occur. The network can have one or more hidden layers. Each hidden layer applies weights, biases, and activation functions to transform the input into something meaningful for the model.\\rNeurons\\rThe basic units in each layer. Each neuron takes inputs, applies weights and biases, sums them, and passes the result through an activation function. The output is then passed to neurons in the next layer.\\rWeights\\rParameters that determine the strength and direction of the connection between neurons in adjacent layers. Weights are learned during training and adjusted to minimize the loss function.\\rBiases\\rAdditional parameters added to the weighted sum of inputs before applying the activation function. Biases help the model fit the data better by shifting the activation function.\\rActivation Functions\\rFunctions applied at each neuron to introduce non-linearity. Common functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, which allow the model to capture complex patterns in the data.\\rOutput Layer\\rThe final layer that provides the predictions or output of the model.

A lower learning rate makes smaller adjustments and converges slowly, while a higher learning rate can speed up training but may overshoot the optimal solution.\\rEpoch\\rOne full pass through the entire training dataset. During an epoch, the model processes the data, calculates the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the weights. Multiple epochs are needed for the model to learn effectively.\\rBatch Size\\rThe number of training samples processed in one forward and backward pass. Small batch sizes lead to noisier updates but can help generalize better, while large batch sizes provide more stable updates but may require more memory.\\rRegularization\\rTechniques (such as L1 and L2 regularization or dropout) used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function or randomly disabling neurons during training.\\rDropout\\rA regularization technique where a random set of neurons is ignored (dropped out) during each training iteration. This forces the model to learn more robust features and helps prevent overfitting.\\rSoftmax\\rA function often used in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks.

The generator aims to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake data.\\rInput Data\\rInput to the generator is typically random noise (latent space vectors), while the discriminator takes both real data (from the training set) and fake data (generated by the generator).\\rOutput\\r- Generator Output: A data instance (e.g., an image) generated from random noise.\\r\\n- Discriminator Output: A probability score indicating whether the input data is real or fake.\\rArchitecture\\rGANs consist of two networks:\\r\\n- Generator Network: Learns to create realistic data by transforming random noise into meaningful samples.\\r\\n- Discriminator Network: Learns to distinguish between real and generated data, providing feedback to the generator.\\rTraining Process\\rGANs are trained in a two-step adversarial process:\\r\\n1.

Used to store structured data.\\rDelimited text file formats\\rText files are used to store data where each line or row has values separated by a delimiter. A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters specifying the boundary between values. Common delimiters include comma, tab, colon, vertical bar, and space.\\rNoSQL databases\\rDatabases are designed to store and manage unstructured data and provide analysis tools for examining this type of data.\\rOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems\\rSystems that focus on handling business transactions and storing structured data.\\rRelational databases\\rDatabases are designed to store structured data with well-defined schemas and support standard data analysis methods and tools.\\rSensors\\rDevices such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags generate structured data.\\rSpreadsheets\\rSoftware applications like Excel and Google Spreadsheets are used for organizing and analyzing structured data.\\rSQL Databases\\rDatabases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data in structured formats.\\rTab-separated values (TSVs)\\rDelimited text files where the delimiter is a tab. Used as an alternative to CSV when literal commas are present in text data.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\nProgramming Ocean Academy- Data Science Bootcamp - Feb 2024\\rTerm\\rDefinition\\rData Repository\\rA general term used to refer to data that has been collected, organized, and isolated so that it can be used for business operations or mined for reporting and data analysis. It can be a small or large database infrastructure with one or more databases that collect, manage, and store data sets. In this video, we will provide an overview of the different types of repositories your data might reside in, such as databases, data warehouses, and big data stores, and examine them in greater detail in further videos.\\rDatabase\\rA collection of data, or information, designed for the input, storage, search and retrieval, and modification of data. A Database Management System, or DBMS, is a set of programs that creates and maintains the database. It allows you to store, modify, and extract information from the database using a function called querying.\\rRelational Databases\\rAlso referred to as RDBMSes, relational databases build on the organizational principles of flat files, with data organized into a tabular format with rows and columns following a well-defined structure and schema. Unlike flat files, RDBMSes are optimized for data operations and querying involving many tables and much larger data volumes. Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the standard querying language for relational databases.\\rNon-Relational Databases\\rAlso known as NoSQL, or \"Not Only SQL\", non-relational databases emerged in response to the volume, diversity, and speed at which data is being generated today, mainly influenced by advances in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and social media proliferation. Built for speed, flexibility, and scale, non-relational databases made it possible to store data in a schema-less or free-form fashion. NoSQL is widely used for processing big data.\\rData Warehouse\\rA central repository that merges information coming from disparate sources and consolidates it through the extract, transform, and load process (ETL process) into one comprehensive database for analytics and business intelligence. At a very high-level, the ETL process helps you to extract data from different data sources, transform the data into a clean and usable state, and load the data into the enterprise\\'s data repository.\\rData Marts\\rData marts are subsets of data warehouses that focus on specific business lines or departments.\\rData Lakes\\rData lakes are repositories that store vast amounts of raw data in its native format until it is needed.\\rBig Data Stores\\rDistributed computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale, and process very large data sets.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\nProgramming Ocean Academy- Data Science Bootcamp - Feb 2024\\rTerm\\rDefinition\\rRelational Database\\rA collection of data organized into a table structure, where the tables can be linked based on common data. Tables consist of rows and columns, with rows representing records and columns representing attributes. Tables can be related based on shared data, allowing for the retrieval of new tables with a single query. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying data. They minimize data redundancy, offer data integrity through data type constraints, and provide security features for controlled access to data.\\rExamples of Relational Databases\\r- IBM DB2 - Microsoft SQL Server - MySQL - Oracle Database - PostgreSQL - Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) - Google Cloud SQL - IBM DB2 on Cloud - Oracle Cloud - SQL Azure\\rAdvantages of Relational Databases\\r- Flexibility: Changes can be made to the database structure while it\\'s running. - Reduced redundancy: Minimizes data duplication. - Ease of backup and disaster recovery: Offers easy export/import options and continuous mirroring in cloud-based solutions. - ACID-compliance: Ensures data accuracy and consistency. - Well-documented and mature technology.\\rUse Cases for Relational Databases\\r- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): Well-suited for transaction-oriented tasks with frequent queries and updates. - Data Warehouses: Optimized for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) for historical data analysis. - IoT Solutions: Lightweight database solution for collecting and processing data from edge devices.\\rLimitations of Relational Databases\\r- Not suitable for semi-structured and unstructured data analytics. - Migration between RDBMSs requires identical schemas and data types. - Limits on the length of data fields.\\rContinued Relevance of RDBMS\\rDespite the evolution of data technologies, such as big data and IoT, relational databases continue to be the predominant technology for working with structured data\\r\\r\\n\\r\\nProgramming Ocean Academy- Data Science Bootcamp -

A higher learning rate speeds up training but may overshoot, while a lower rate offers more precise adjustments but slower convergence.\\rActivation\\rThe function applied at each neuron in a neural network layer, introducing non-linearity into the model. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.\\rRegularization\\rA technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty (or constraint) to the loss function. Common methods include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\\rRegularization Rate\\rA hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularization applied. A higher regularization rate increases the penalty on larger weights, helping to simplify the model and reduce overfitting.\\rRatio of Training to Test Size\\rThe proportion of the dataset used for training versus testing (or validation). A typical split might be 80% training and 20% testing. The training set is used for learning, while the test set evaluates model performance on unseen data.\\rNoise\\rUnwanted variations or randomness in the data that can distort the learning process. In deep learning, noise can arise from data collection errors, or it can be deliberately introduced as a regularization technique (e.g., dropout, adding Gaussian noise).\\rBatch Size\\rThe number of training examples processed in one iteration. Smaller batch sizes lead to noisier updates but require less memory and can generalize better. Larger batch sizes can be more stable but may lead to slower generalization. Common sizes include 32, 64, and 128.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA table explaining the anatomy of a neural network in deep learning- Programming Ocean Academy\\rComponent\\rExplanation\\rInput Layer\\rThe first layer in the neural network that receives the raw data (features) to be processed. Each neuron in this layer corresponds to one feature from the input data.\\rHidden Layers\\rIntermediate layers between the input and output layers, where most of the computations occur. The network can have one or more hidden layers. Each hidden layer applies weights, biases, and activation functions to transform the input into something meaningful for the model.\\rNeurons\\rThe basic units in each layer. Each neuron takes inputs, applies weights and biases, sums them, and passes the result through an activation function. The output is then passed to neurons in the next layer.\\rWeights\\rParameters that determine the strength and direction of the connection between neurons in adjacent layers. Weights are learned during training and adjusted to minimize the loss function.\\rBiases\\rAdditional parameters added to the weighted sum of inputs before applying the activation function. Biases help the model fit the data better by shifting the activation function.\\rActivation Functions\\rFunctions applied at each neuron to introduce non-linearity. Common functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, which allow the model to capture complex patterns in the data.\\rOutput Layer\\rThe final layer that provides the predictions or output of the model. The number of neurons in the output layer typically corresponds to the number of prediction classes or the target variables in regression.\\rForward Propagation\\rThe process where input data passes through the network from the input layer, through hidden layers, to the output layer, generating predictions based on current weights and biases.\\rLoss Function\\rA function that measures the error or difference between the predicted output and the actual target value. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error for regression and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.\\rBackpropagation\\rThe process of calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the network, starting from the output layer and moving backward through the layers. This allows the network to learn by updating the weights to minimize the loss.\\rOptimization Algorithm\\rAn algorithm (such as Stochastic Gradient Descent or Adam) used to update the network\\'s weights and biases based on the gradients computed during backpropagation, to minimize the loss function.\\rLearning Rate\\rA hyperparameter that controls how much to adjust the weights during each update. A lower learning rate makes smaller adjustments and converges slowly, while a higher learning rate can speed up training but may overshoot the optimal solution.\\rEpoch\\rOne full pass through the entire training dataset. During an epoch, the model processes the data, calculates the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the weights. Multiple epochs are needed for the model to learn effectively.\\rBatch Size\\rThe number of training samples processed in one forward and backward pass. Small batch sizes lead to noisier updates but can help generalize better, while large batch sizes provide more stable updates but may require more memory.\\rRegularization\\rTechniques (such as L1 and L2 regularization or dropout) used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function or randomly disabling neurons during training.\\rDropout\\rA regularization technique where a random set of neurons is ignored (dropped out) during each training iteration. This forces the model to learn more robust features and helps prevent overfitting.\\rSoftmax\\rA function often used in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks.

Rate\\rLoss Rate\\rOverfitting\\rUnderfitting\\rDefinition\\rThe learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function.\\rThe loss rate refers to the error or difference between the predicted output and the actual output, typically measured by a loss function (e.g., MSE, Cross-Entropy).\\rOverfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and details, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.\\rUnderfitting happens when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\\rEffect on Model\\rControls how fast the model updates weights. A high learning rate can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a low learning rate can lead to slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima.\\rA high loss rate indicates poor model performance, while a low loss rate indicates that the model\\'s predictions are closer to the actual values.\\rResults in high accuracy on training data but poor performance on testing data due to memorization of noise rather than learning the general pattern.\\rLeads to both poor training and testing accuracy because the model is too simplistic to capture complex patterns.\\rCauses\\rA high learning rate may skip the optimal solution, and a low learning rate may take too long to converge.\\rHigh loss rate occurs due to a poorly trained model, improper hyperparameters, or incorrect data preprocessing.\\rToo complex models with too many parameters, insufficient regularization, or too much training time.\\rToo simple models with insufficient complexity, inadequate training, or incorrect features.\\rSymptoms\\rHigh learning rate: unstable training and large loss oscillations.
